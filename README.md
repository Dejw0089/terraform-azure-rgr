## 📖 Introduction

The **Terraform Azure RGR** module simplifies the process of deploying resources in Azure. It leverages Terraform, a powerful tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. This module focuses on a specific resource group (RGR) setup, making it easier for developers and DevOps teams to manage their Azure resources.

## 🌟 Features

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Define your infrastructure using simple configuration files.
- **Automated Provisioning**: Quickly set up and manage resources without manual intervention.
- **Modular Design**: Easily integrate with other Terraform modules and Azure services.
- **Version Control**: Track changes to your infrastructure with Git and Terraform.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works seamlessly across different environments and operating systems.

## 🛠️ Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dejw0089/terraform-azure-rgr.git
cd terraform-azure-rgr
```

Next, ensure you have [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed. You can check your installation by running:

```bash
terraform -v
```

## 📦 Usage

To use this module, you will need to create a Terraform configuration file that references the Azure RGR module. Below is a simple example:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

module "rgr" {
  source              = "./terraform-azure-rgr"
  resource_group_name = "my-resource-group"
  location           = "East US"
}
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The module accepts several input variables to customize the deployment. Below are the key variables:

- `resource_group_name`: The name of the resource group to create.
- `location`: The Azure region where the resources will be deployed.

You can define these variables in a `terraform.tfvars` file:

```hcl
resource_group_name = "my-resource-group"
location           = "East US"
```

## 🚀 Deployment

Once you have your configuration set up, you can deploy your resources using Terraform commands. Run the following commands in your terminal:

1. **Initialize Terraform**:

```bash
terraform init
```

2. **Plan the Deployment**:

```bash
terraform plan
```

3. **Apply the Configuration**:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Terraform will prompt you to confirm the changes. Type `yes` to proceed.
